# Feature Requests

A shared place for feature ideas, wherever they come from — the office, a fitter suggestion, or from a Claude session that doesn't have direct access to Claude Code. Edit this file directly on GitHub (no need to touch Claude Code) and Claude will read it when working in this repo.

**How to add a request**: add a new entry under "Requested", with your name and today's date. Don't worry about wording it perfectly or prioritizing it — just get it down, and it'll get discussed and scoped properly before anything is built.

## Requested

### Fitter end-of-job checklist with sign-off
- Requested by: office — 2026-07-30
- A checklist of things fitters need to do/confirm at the end of a job, with some kind of sign-off.

### Customer sector categorization: Retail / Trade / Commercial
- Requested by: office — 2026-07-30
- Classify customers by industry sector, to report on customer counts and average margins per sector.

### WindowCAD7 API integration
- Requested by: office — 2026-07-30
- Connect the existing "WindowCAD7 Reference" field to a real API instead of it just being a free-text label.

### Multiple installation dates per job (phased installs)
- Requested by: Dan — 2026-08-07
- "Please can we add an option to add another installation date so we have the option to book more than one install date per job card. As we will get it a lot where we will do installations in phases."
- Bigger than it first looks: a Job's install date is currently a single field, read from directly by the automatic email reminder timer, the Fitter Calendar, Kanban card badges, and Dashboard delivery tracking — all of these would need to handle multiple dates/phases, not just the Installation tab's own booking UI. Needs a proper design pass before building, not a quick add.

## Resolved / not needed

### Multi-job/multi-survey booking per fitter per day
- Requested by: office — 2026-07-30
- Turned out to already work — nothing in the app prevents or hides multiple bookings for the same fitter on the same day; both the office and fitter mobile calendars already show every booking for a day. No build needed, confirmed 2026-07-30.
